# Continuous Feature Structures

## Traditional way

### LSTMs

Represent sentences as vectors. The length of sentences increases the difficulties of representing them exponentially.

* Lossy
* Exponential grow in magnitudes
* Sensitive to exponentially small changes

The last tow makes SGD challenging. Maybe a lossy representation is good enough?

### LSTMs with Attentions

* Additional structures
* A set of vectors



### Theoretical Feature Structures

* Features are acyclic graph
* Features are edges
* Nodes are types
* Strictly non-differerntiable

### Continuous Types
* Binary embedding of types
* Fuzzy logic controlled type unification
* Max? is not continuous?

### Feature Structures
* Fuzzy Control
