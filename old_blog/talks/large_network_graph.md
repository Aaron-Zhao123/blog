# Large Networks, from Mathematics to Machine Learning

Speaker: Christian Borgs

## Question
    1. What is the limit of large sparse networks?

    2. How to model massive real-world networks?

Meaningful way of comparing large networks: **graph convergence and limits**.

## Matrix Completion

    * Complete a matrix with probability ratings given concrete sampled information

    * Sparsity in data causes a challenge in linking two entries: Expand to neighborhood to build a link.

## Non-parametric Graph Modeling

    * Blocked Model: well studied but needs to fit into the context

    * Inhomogeneous Random Graph: estimate i, j based on a hand-made feature space.


## Keywords:

* Cut Norm
* Graph Convergence
