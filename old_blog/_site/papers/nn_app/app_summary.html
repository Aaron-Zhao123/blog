<h4 id="1-neural-architecture-search-with-reinforcement-learning">1. Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning</h4>

<p><strong>Review</strong>(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Paper link</a>)
This work uses a recurrent network to generate definitions of a neural network’s structure.
The process of generating an architecture stops if the number of layers exceeds a certain value.
This value follows a schedule where we increase it as training progresses.
To accelerate training, they used asynchronous updates by placing multiple controllers
They allow controller to propose skip connections or branching layers, thereby widening the search space.
This skipping is achieved using a  set-selection type attention which was built upon the attention mechanism.
The search space is too large for large datasets, so the experiments are finished on CIFAR-10 only, and even this costs them 800 GPUs.</p>

<h4 id="2-learning-transferable-architectures-for-scalable-image-recognition">2. Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition</h4>
<p><strong>Review</strong>(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Paper link</a>)
This paper proposed to automate the process of neural network architecture
by using reinforcement learning to learn model architectures building blocks.
This approach limits the search space and successfully learned building blocks
can be transferred from to large datasets.
They use NAS to search for a good architecture on the far smaller CIFAR-10 dataset, and automatically transfer the learned architecture to ImageNet.
Two types of convolutional cells are considered:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Normal cell:
convolutional cells that return a feature map of the same dimension.</li>
  <li>Reduction cell:
convolutional cells that return a feature map where the feature map height and width is reduced by a factor of two.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reinforcement learning method asks each hidden sate in the cell to select
from a set of pre-defined operations, and append it to the cell. This action
is repeated multiple times to search for one particular block to append to a
given hidden state of a given cell.
The number of repetition is set to 5 to limit the search space.
The search strategy costs a pool of workers of 500 GPUs.</p>

<p>Note:
“We use a common heuristic to double the number of filters in the output whenever the spatial activation size is reduced in order to maintain roughly constant hidden state dimension.”
This is a very interesting statement.</p>

<h4 id="3-learning-to-represent-programs-with-graphs-iclr-2018">3. Learning to Represent Programs with Graphs (ICLR 2018)</h4>
<p><strong>Review</strong>(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00740">Paper link</a>)
This paper considers to tasks: 1) VARNAMING, 2) VARMISUSE.
They encode programs as graphs, in which the edges represents syntactic
relationships (e.g. “token before/after”) and semantic relationships
(“variable last used/written here”, “formal parameter for argument is called stream”, etc.).</p>

<h4 id="4-zero-shot-visual-imitation-iclr-2018">4. ZERO-SHOT VISUAL IMITATION (ICLR 2018)</h4>
<p>Imitating expert demonstration is a powerful mechanism for learning to perform
tasks.
The expert typically provides multiple demonstrations of a task at training time,
and this generates data in the form of observation-action pairs from the agent’s point of view.
A function that predicts the sequence of actions to take the agent from the
current observation to the goal is called a goal-conditioned skill policy (GSP).
They use the difference in the output of the forward model for the GSP-selected
action and the ground truth next state to train the GSP.
This loss has the effect of making the GSP-predicted action consistent with
the ground-truth action instead of exactly matching the actions themselves,
thus ensuring that actions that are different from the ground-truth—but
lead to the same next state— are not inadvertently penalized.
To account for varying number of steps required to reach different goals,
we propose to jointly optimize the GSP with a goal recognizer that
determines if the current goal has been satisfied.
This method is zero-shot because because the agent never has access to
expert actions, neither during training of the GSP nor for task demonstration
at inference.
The agent therefore can learn from short video clips or even a sequence of images.</p>
