## An event-triggered programmable prefetch

#### Array-indirect access
Hard to know, data dependent

#### implementations
Snoop and prefetch data using address filter.
Observe ad put into queue and then put to a scheduler.
Prefetch now can prefetch based on prefetched results.

#### Programmable model
Event triggered prefetch kernels.
Compiler automation: bounds and invariants translate to chained events
