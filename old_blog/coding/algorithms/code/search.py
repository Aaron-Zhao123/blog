# BFS
#   vertices are processed by a queue
#   O(V+E)
# DFS
#   vertices are processed by recursion ~ stack
#   O(V+E)
# 3 ways of representing a graph

# In-order
    # Left, Root, Right, gives proper indexing
# Pre-order
    # Root, Left, Right, create trees
# Post-order
    # Left, Right, Root, delete trees
