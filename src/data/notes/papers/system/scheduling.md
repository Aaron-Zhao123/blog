## <a id="swithces"></a>Switches and Routers
#### 1. **Scaling Internet Routers using Optics**
**Review**([Paper link](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=863978))
  1.	The capacity of router must grow but growth in router speed seems less important.
  2.	Two problems on multi-rack systems: unpredictable performance and poor scalability.
  3.	The architecture: Load balancing -> N*N VOQs -> switch; both switches are equal-rates and serve in a deterministic manner.
  4.	If output nodes also serve as intermediate nodes, the same setup is achieved using only one fixed switch with a loss of 50% in throughputs.
  5.	In TCP, packets arriving to the destination with wrong order triggers retransmissions.
  6.	 Fully ordered frames first (FOFF)

#### 2. **Load balanced Birkhoff-von Neumann switches**
**Review**([Paper link](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/923646/))
  1. The main drawback is that FIFO might be violated for packets from the same input.
  Two classes of systems: multi-rack system and single-stage switches.
  2. The complexity for the switch is O(N).
  3.	Load balancing works by making incoming packets of different queues become evenly distributed on the output side. The evenly distributed queues are then be served concurrently on the second-stage buffer.

#### 3. Maintaining Packet Order in Two-Stage Switches
**Review**([Paper link](http://yuba.stanford.edu/~nickm/papers/Infocom02_two_stage.pdf))
  1.	The scalability of most input-queued switches is limited by the scheduling algorithm.
  2.	Two stage switching â€“ load balancing spreads data traffic uniformly for the next stage. Is it possible to find a more efficient spreading algorithm?
  3.	EDF (Earlier deadline first) algorithm prevents miss-sequencing by serving cells in VOQs in the order that they arrived to the switch.
  4.	3DQ, the use of 3-dimensional virtual queueing to avoid HOL.
  5.	FFF (Full Frames First): algorithms deal with frames rather than packets. The priority of serving frames is higher than serving packets. Only there are no full frames requiring services, it serves non-full frames in round-robin fashion.

## <a id="course"></a> Network architectures
#### 1. Towards a SPDY'ier mobile web?
**Review**([Paper link](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2535399))
SPDY, a recently proposed alter-native  to  HTTP,  tries  to  address  many  of  the  limitations of HTTP (e.g., multiple connections, setup latency).

#### 2. QUIC
**Review**([Paper link](https://blog.chromium.org/2015/04/a-quic-update-on-googles-experimental.html))
A UDP-based transport protocol developed by Google, the aim is to replace the
TCP protocol with this light-weight protocol.
