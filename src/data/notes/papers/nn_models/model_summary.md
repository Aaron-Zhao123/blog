## [](#alexnet)AlexNet
**Review**([Paper link](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf))
This is an early work of using deep CNN. The tricky parts are the padding sizes and group sizes. Some groups sizes are set to 2 due to the memory limitation of GPU at that time. The model in Caffee Zoo also takes a group count of two.

## [](#vgg)VGG
**Review**([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556))
VggNet steadily increase the depth by adding more convolutional layers.
A lot of 3-by-3 convolutional filters are utilized.
Normally train with a decaying learning rate and around 70 epochs.

## [](#inception)Inception
**Review**([InceptionV1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167), [InceptionV2,InceptionV3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567))
In the Batch Norm paper, Sergey et al. proposed InceptionV1 architecture, which is very similar to GoogleNet.
They introduced the very important concept of batch norm to speed up learning and also increases accuracy.
Later on, the authors proposed InceptionV2 and InceptionV3.
In the Inception-v2, they introduced Factorization (factorize convolutions into smaller convolutions) and some minor change into Inception-v1.
As for Inception-v3, it is a variant of Inception-v2 which adds BN-auxiliary.

## [](#snet)SqueezeNet
**Review**([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07360.pdf)))
SqueezeNet work by replacing standard convolutional layers into a **fire module**.
The fire module contains a squeeze layer and an expand layer.
The squeeze layer has only 1*1 convolutional filters to expand the activation map.
The expand layer than a mixed 1*1 and 3*3 filters.
The paper presents compression results of SqueezeNet using Han's Deep Compression.

## [](#mobilenet)MobileNet
**Review**([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf),[blog](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/06/mobilenets-open-source-models-for.html))

MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses
**depth-wise separable convolutions** to build light weight networks.
**Depth-wise seperable convolution** breaks a standard convolutional layer into depth-wise layers and point-wise layers.
Tradeoff between latency and accuracy are determined by two hyperparameters.
One parameter is called **width multiplier**, this hyperparameter defines how "thin" the network is by multiplying itself to both input and output channel counts.
The second hyperparameter is **Resolution multiplier**, this works by reduce the kernel width.

At the end, they found a near linear relationship between the accuracy and the number of MAC.

## [](#SENet)GBD-Net
**Review**([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507))

The winner of **ILSVRC 2016**. In order to use the contextual information, multiple image regions surrounding the candidate box were cropped in and whole-image classification scores were used in. In GBD-net, they use gate functions for controlling message passing.
Message passing at the feature level was studied in Recurrent neural network (RNN) and gate functions are used to control message passing in long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
GBD-net takes an image as input, uses roi-pooling operations to obtain features with different resolutions and different support regions for each candidate box, and then the gated bi-direction layer is used for passing messages among features, and final classification is made.

## [](#SENet)Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks
**Review**([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507))

The winner of **ILSVRC 2017**. At each layer, it average pools the feature maps
(squeeze) and feed them into a small fully connected network.
This tiny network then output a scaling factor for the following feature maps
to excite them.
