<h1>Ancient solution notes</h1>

<p>This set of directories is deprecated and may be relocated in due course.
The main URL for solution notes for exam questions is on
<a href="../pastpapers/">www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/</a>
where all solution notes from 2006 are stored, and periodically released
to students.

<p>This directory contains older solution notes.  <b>These cannot generally
be released to students</b> because prior to the 2005 IPR legislation in
the University, explicit lecturer permission is required for copyright reasons.
From 2006 onwards lecturers implicitly give the university a copyright licence.

<p>These older solution notes are also less useful in general having suffered
syllabus drift etc.

<p>Original text:

<p>The solution notes kept here for the Student Administrators were
produced by question setters primarily for the benefit of the internal and
external Examiners for the Computer Science Tripos. It
is <a href="../../supervisions/support.html">Computer Laboratory
policy</a> that the paper copies kept in the Student Administration
Office may be made available to supervisors for photocopying, <b>on
the understanding that they will not in general be made available to
students</b>. Lecturers who want to make their own solution notes
available directly to students can do so via their
own <a href="../../material.html">course-material web pages</a>.

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The solution notes from 2004 and
earlier years are as submitted to the External Examiner in March. The
solution notes from 2005 and later incorporate any changes made in
June (although there are very few of these).</p>
