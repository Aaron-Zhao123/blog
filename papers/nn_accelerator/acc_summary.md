#### 1. SCNN: An Accelerator for Compressed-sparseConvolutional Neural Network

**Review**([Paper link](http://people.csail.mit.edu/anurag_m/papers/2017.scnn.isca.pdf))

#### 2. ZeNA: Zero-Aware Neural Network Accelerator

**Review**([Paper link](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8013151/))
A hardware architecture that skips zeros in a neural network.
The major problem of valina-sparsity is that parallel threads might have imbalanced
sparsity.
This hardware architecture locally broadcast to other processing units to help
balancing the workloads.
They also propose to use work stealing and dynamic allocations to balance the workloads.

**Review**([Paper link]())
Yolo is a framework that uses darknets to perform real time object recognition.
The Fast Yolo system is built on Yolo and try to avoid redundant calculations
with the streamed inputs.
It performs an action that it called "motion-adaptive inference".
For each video frame, an image stack consisting of the video frame with a reference frame is passed into a 1 Ã— 1 convolutional layer.
The result of the convolutional layer is a motion probability map, which is then fed into a motion-adaptive inference module to determine if deep inference is needed to compute an updated class probability map.
