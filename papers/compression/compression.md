# [](#compression)Compression

A range of compression techniques are summarized:
* Pruning
* Quantization
* Regularization, knowledge distillation and etc

### [Pruning](/blog/papers/compression/pruning.html)
Pruning refers to move away connections in a neural network for compressing the size of it, both fine-grained and coarse-grained
pruning are discussed.

### [Quantization](/blog/papers/compression/quantization.html)
Various quantization methods: fixed-point, dynamic fixed-point, binarized, tenary.

### [Regularizations and etc](/blog/papers/compression/other.html)
Novel regularizers are considered as compression techniques.
