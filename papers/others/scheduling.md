1. **Scaling Internet Routers using Optics**
> **Review**([Paper link](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=863978))
> > The need of larger capacity of router is more than the need of faster routers.
> > Two classes of systems: multi-rack system and single-stage switches.
> > 1. Multi-rack system uses distributed switches, but suffers from unpredictable performance and poor scalability.
> > 2. Single-stage system (crossbar with input output queueing) uses scheduling
algorithms such as iSLP and WFA. Centralized schedulers donâ€™t scale with an increase in the number of ports, or with an increase in the line-rate.
> >
> > load-balancing -> fixed, equal-rate input switch -> N*N VOQs -> fixed, equal-rate output switch.
> > It achieves 100% throughput without using a centralized swtich

2. **Load balanced Birkhoff-von Neumann switches**
> **Review**([Paper link](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/923646/))
