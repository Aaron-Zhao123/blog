#### **1. Pruning Filters for Efficient ConvNets**

**Review**([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.08710)) Fine-grained sparsity requires libraries to explore its advantage. An interesting point: maintaining sparse data structures also creates an additional storage overhead which can be significant for low-precision weights.
Instead of layer-wise iterative fine-tuning (retraining), they use one-shot pruning and retraining to save retraining time for pruning filters across multiple layers, which is critical for pruning very deep networks.
Pruning based on sum of absolute kernel weights. Sort the rank based on that metric and prune the ones that have lowest value (very arbitrary in a sense). They introduced both **Independent pruning** and **Greedy pruning** for pruning across multiple layers. In **Independent pruning**, only filters in a same layers are considered, in contrast, **Greedy pruning** takes account of removed values in previous layers.
In ResNet, the pruning results can be affected by shorcutting connections, to prune the second convolutional layer of the residual block, the corresponding projected feature maps must also be pruned.
Smallest filter pruning outperforms feature map pruning with the metrics (eg: mean, std, meanl1, meanl2  ... ).

#### **2. Learning Structured Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks**

**Review**([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.08710))
This paper explores filer-wise, channel-wise, shape-wise and depth-wise
sparsities. Penalizing multiple weights structures using group-lasso (
adding arbitrary hyperparameters in the cost function). The interesting observation
is to combine both filter-wise and shape-wise sparsity in GEMM operations,
where a high dimensional matrix is unrolled to a flat one. The rows and
columns of GEMM can be removed directly. Their code can be found at
[here](https://github.com/wenwei202/caffe/tree/scnn).

#### **3. Fast ConvNets Using Group-wise Brain Damage**

**Review**([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02515))
This paper has a nice explaination of GEMM (generalized matrix multiplication). The consider a
"group regularizer" that is essentially based on
L2 and L1 norms.
Two pruning strategies are considered. The first
method adds the regularizer directly to a trained network and force a number of groups with smallest L2 norms to zeros.
The second method inspects a validation set and
increase the "brain damage" with a control of
loss of test accuracy.

#### **4. Learning to Prune Deep Neural Networks via Layer-wise Optimal Brain Surgeon**

**Review**([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07565))
This paper proposed a new layer-wise pruning method, and theoretically proved that only a light retraining is required to resume the test accuracy.
The parameters with least increase of error approximated by second-order directives are pruned. The second order derivative approximation requires an inverse of Hessian Matrix. This work makes computation easier by: 1. compute layer-wise Hessian; 2. compute a block-wise pesudo-inverse of Hessian and then populate to the whole dataset.

Highlights:
1. The only parameter we have to control is the layer-wise error to ensure gradient to be small enough after pruning.
That is one of reasons why there is a “pruning inflection point” after which layer-wise error would drop dramatically.
2. Significantly less retraining iterations, around two magnitudes smaller than other popular methods.

#### **5. Net-Trim: A Layer-wise Convex Pruning of Deep Neural Networks**
**Review** ([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05162))
The first (maybe) paper considers second-order directive pruning in a layer-wise fashion.
A series of convex solvers are used at each layer.
(This is a long paper and a more careful read might happen later)
