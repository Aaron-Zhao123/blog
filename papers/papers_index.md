# [](#nn)Neural Networks
## [Network Models](/blog/papers/nn_models/model_summary.html)

A collection of popular neural network models: from the old LeNet model to ResNet model.
Some interesting network architectures are also collected.

## [Network Compression](/blog/papers/pruning/pruning_summary.html)
A range of compression techniques are summarized:
* Pruning
* Quantization
* Regularization
* Varying network structure
Pruning refers to move away connections in a neural network for compressing the size of it, both fine-grained and coarse-grained
pruning are discussed.
Vairous quantization methods: fixed-point, dynamic fixed-point, binarized, tenary.
Novel regularizers are considered as compression techniques.
