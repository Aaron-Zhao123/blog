  1. **DSD:  DENSE-SPARSE-DENSE Training For Deep Neural Network**
  > > **Review**([Paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04381.pdf))
  > > This paper suggest that training in a dense->sparse->dense fashion provides
  better results.
  > > Because important weights can be found in the pruning phase, the second
  dense process reactivates other unimportant weights to learn to adapt with
  important weights.
